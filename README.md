Drum kit
An online drum kit that plays the corresponding sound when you click the key, or when you hover over it with your mouse if you are on a phone and do not have keys.

*My first steps will be to:

Style the HTML to my liking.
Make the buttons grow when hovered over.
Dim the background image when active.
Figure out a way to output sound & the key that is pressed to the console.
Create an if statement for an event listener that will play a sound when a key is pressed/ clicked.
I will then watch the class to see how they approached the problem.
