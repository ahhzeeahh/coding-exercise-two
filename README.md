Drum kit
An online drum kit that plays the corresponding sound when you click the key, or when you hover over it with your mouse if you are on a phone and do not have keys.

*My first steps will be to:

Style the HTML to my liking.
Make the buttons grow when hovered over.
Dim the background image when active.
Figure out a way to output sound & the key that is pressed to the console.
Create an if statement for an event listener that will play a sound when a key is pressed/ clicked.
I will then watch the class to see how they approached the problem.

The first attempt at JavaScript is the index.js file but I'm going to change the source to the revised.js one. LOCATED inside of the images folder I've also added more sounds to condense the JavaScript

Edit*** 
I looked at how the class did it, they used "switch" statements. I still came up with a shorter condensed way of making this work buy changing the sounds files to different names that can correspond with "i" variable
